Gradient:

For a Div box if we have to give gradient colours:
 use background: linear-gradient (straight) or radial gradient(circle)

Can give as many colours as we want, and give percentages as well like (red 10%, blue)
 
To change the direction in linear use (to left, red, blue) or to right or to right bottom (diagnal)


Image Sizing:

We can create a Div in html and assign an Image for it in the CSS with background-Image
background-size: To make the image cover whole width we use cover and for height we use contain
background-position: We use  to show what part of the image from the resized image

Border:
To give border to any prop use border:
Border: width style colour
Example- border: 2px solid/dotted/dashed white;
border: none (doesnt do anything)

border-radius: 5px/10px (gives curve to the border)
can use 50% to make a circle
